# Yet Another LateX Template Repository

Nice LaTeX templates for university students. I was studying at ENSSAT Lannion, so there is only my university logo now - but feel free to update the logos and whatever you need...

Folders are usually organised with a `params.tex` file which loads libraries and tune parameters, a file `report.tex` which you will need to latexify in order to generate the pdf, and also sometimes a bunch of subfiles included in the main file, to make organisation even more clear.
